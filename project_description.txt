Project was created as part of Visualization and Data Reporting subject
The topic of the task was interactive visualization

My project uses Spotify API to get data about songs related to typed phrase.
Gathered information is displayed in form of list of songs titles with the album cover
and two charts created with tools of the D3 library.

The project is not in its final form it still will be updated.

BUGS:
1. First attempt of searching for the phrase does not trigger list and chart appearance.
2. The range for second chart is not dynamically assigned.
